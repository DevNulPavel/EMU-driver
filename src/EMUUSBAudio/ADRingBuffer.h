     THis function can be called any number of times while we are waiting
     for the framelist read to finish. This can be called both from readHandler and from
     convertInputSamples.
     
     You must lock IO ( IOLockLock(mLock)) before calling this. We can not do this ourselves
     because readHandler (who will need to call us) has to lock before this point and
     locking multiple times ourselves will deadlock.
     
     This function always uses mInput.currentFrameList as the framelist to handle.
     
     @return kIOReturnSuccess if all frames were read properly, or kIOReturnStillOpen if there
     were still un-handled frames in the frame list.
     
     This code directly uses readBuffer to access the bytes.
     
     This function does NOT check for buffer overrun.
     
     This function modifies FrameIndex, lastInputSize, LastInputFrames, and runningInputCount. It may
     also alter bufferOffset but that will result in a warning in the logs.
     
     @param doTimeStamp true if function should also execute makeTimeStampForWrap if a wrap occurs.
     If false, the timestamp will be stored in frameListWrapTimestamp, and will be executed when
     this function is called on the same frame again but then with doTimeStamp=true (which happens at read completion)
