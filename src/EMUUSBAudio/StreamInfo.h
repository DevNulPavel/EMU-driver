 @abstract  the state or our mInput/mOutput USB stream.
 @discussion To handle an USB stream the program joggles with a set of USB frames,
 callback handlers etc. These are grouped in this object.
 
 See also the USB Device interface guide.
 
 The functions used to read from and write to isochronous endpoints are ReadIsochPipeAsync and WriteIsochPipeAsync. Both functions include the following two parameters:
 
 * numFrames—The number of frames for which to transfer data
 
 * frameList—A pointer to an array of structures that describe the frames. specifies the list of transfers you want to occur.

     When a framelist is complete, readhHandler copies the data from the frame list
     to the mInput buffer so that the frameList can be redeployed.
     We need this (1) to have a fixed ring buffer as HAL is expecting us to have
     (2) to free up the framelist so that we can redeploy it to continue reading
     (3) so that we can do int-to-float conversion 'offline'.
     However it seems that these are no strong reasons, probably we could just simulate a ring buffer
     and redeploy the frameList only after conversion for the HAL.
